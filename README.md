# nodejs-scraper

ðŸš€ Work in progress ðŸš€  
The setup of a basic webscraper build on NodeJS with [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) (Headless chrome browser).  
Right now it is set to Hackernoon articles, this can be changed if you search for the right DOM elements on your desired source.

## Idea

Build an web scraper for medium articles by subject

## TODO:

-   Support tags / subject input.
-   Build a dashboard based on the articles gathered.
