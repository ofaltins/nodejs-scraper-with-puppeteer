# nodejs-scraper

ðŸš€ Work in progress ðŸš€  
The setup of a basic webscraper build on NodeJS with [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) (Headless chrome browser).  
  
  
## Idea
Build an web scraper for medium articles by subject

## TODO:
- Gather multiple articles from Medium (only returns 1 for now, other sites i scraped it returned multiple).
- Support tags / subject input.
- Build a dashboard based on the articles gathered.
