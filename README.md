# nodejs-scraper

ðŸš€ Work in progress ðŸš€  
The setup of a basic webscraper build on NodeJS with [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) (Headless chrome browser).  
Right now it is set to Hackernoon articles, this can be changed if you search for the right DOM elements on your desired source.

## Start the project:
- Clone the repo
- `cd` into it
- ```Npm install```
- ```Nodemon index```

## Idea

Build an web scraper for hackernoon articles by subject

## TODO:

-   Tackle infinite scrolling issue
-   Support multiple tags / subject input.
-   Build a dashboard based on the articles gathered.
